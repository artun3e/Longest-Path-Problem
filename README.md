# Longest-Path-Problem
Given an undirected graph G(V, E) with n nodes, the nodes s and t âˆˆ V and a positive integer k, the longest path problem asks to compute a simple path that exists between s and t in G which contains at least k edges

In short:
Our NP-Complete Problem : Longest Path 
Input: n-node undirected graph G(V, E); nodes s and t in V; positive integer k. 
Our Question: Is there a simple path between s and t in G that contains at least k edges?

Project aims to find a heuristic approach for the Longest Path Problem
